  caveats <<~EOS
    Atlas Studio Nightly is signed ad hoc, not with an Apple Developer ID,
    so macOS blocks its first start. Open it once, then allow it in
      System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway

    It installs its own updates (Atlas Studio Nightly > Check for Updates...),
    which open without asking again. `brew upgrade --greedy` installs
    a new copy that macOS asks about once more.
